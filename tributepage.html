            <h2>About Him</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India.
                Known as the “People’s President”, he played a crucial role in the development of India's
                missile and nuclear programs. He inspired millions of young minds with his vision and
                simplicity.
                As he himself wrote in Wings of Fire, APJ Abdul Kalam’s journey from a modest childhood in Rameswaram to becoming India’s 
                “Missile Man” reflects extraordinary perseverance and belief in hard work. 
                He described how financial struggles and early setbacks only strengthened his determination to learn and grow.
                His life shows that greatness is built through dedication, humility, and continuous effort. In Wings of Fire, 
                Kalam inspires readers by proving that anyone, regardless of background, can rise to remarkable heights. 
                He turns his experiences into a guiding path for dreamers, urging them to aim higher and never give up.
                His reflections on failure and success motivate aspiring minds to convert obstacles into opportunities. 
                Through his story, he reminds us that with vision and self-belief, we can transform our dreams into reality.
